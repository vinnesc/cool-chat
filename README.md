# What is Xion?
Xion is a project that I started to re-learn C++. Not only I wanted to improve my skills with the language, but also to learn the new versions that had come out since I used it for the first time, like C++14. This also served as an opportunity to dig a little bit deeper into network programming, which is something I had always been interested in. Topics like _asynchronous I/O_, _multi-threading_ and _packet structure_ started to show up during the development of this project. Those are the main reasons why I got hooked up on this project and decided to give it my best shot.
